# Title: Household Income and Expenditure Statistical Analysis with Investment Comparison

### Description:
This project analyzes a dataset of household income and expenditure data to derive key statistical insights. The dataset contains information about monthly household income, expenses, number of earning members, and the highest qualified member in each household. Various statistical analyses, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and interquartile range (IQR), are performed to summarize household expenses and income patterns. Additionally, an investment analysis between two hypothetical stocks, Stock A and Stock B, is also carried out based on expected returns and risk (measured by standard deviation), using the coefficient of variation.

### Responsibilities:
#### 1.Data Preprocessing:
* Data cleaning and handling of missing values.
* Data transformation and preparation for analysis.
#### 2.Descriptive Analytics:
* Computation of statistical metrics (mean, median, IQR, standard deviation, variance).
* Exploration of central tendency and dispersion of household income and expenditure variables.
#### 3.Data Visualization:
* Plotting histograms and bar charts for visual representation of categorical variables.
* Scatter plots for relationship analysis between monthly household income and expenditure.
#### 4.Investment Performance Analysis:
* Calculation of the Coefficient of Variation for two stocks to assess risk-adjusted returns.
* Decision-making based on statistical comparisons of investment alternatives.

### Libraries:
1.Pandas: 
* Data manipulation and statistical calculations.
2.NumPy:
* Efficient computation of statistical values and numerical operations.
3.Seaborn:
* High-level interface for statistical data visualization.
4.Matplotlib:
* Basic plotting and visualization tools for exploratory analysis.
